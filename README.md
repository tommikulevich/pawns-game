### 📰 About | Rules

Console game **Pawns** for 2 players has been implemented. There are pawns on **the board** in at least 4 rows (players choose this number). Players take turns making moves. The move consists of taking *a single pawn* or *all the pawn pieces* from one row (players give **the row number** and the letters **'o'** (one pawn) or **'a'** (all pawns) - e.g. 1a, 7o etc). **The player who takes the last pawn loses**.
